Wexflow is a high-performance, extensible, modular and cross-platform workflow engine. The goal of Wexflow is to automate recurring tasks without user intervention. With the help of Wexflow, building automation and workflow processes become easy. Wexflow also helps in making the long-running processes straightforward. 

Wexflow aims to make automations, workflow processes, long-running processes and interactions between systems, applications and folks easy, straightforward and clean. The communication between systems or applications becomes easy through this powerful workflow engine.

Wexflow makes use of [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download), a cross-platform version of .NET for building websites, services, and console apps. Thus, Wexflow provides a cross-platform workflow server and a cross-platform backend for managing, designing and tracking workflows with ease and flexibility. Wexflow server and its backend run on Windows, Linux and macOS.

Wexflow also makes use of [Quartz.NET](https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/) open source job scheduling system that is used in large scale enterprise systems. Thus, Wexflow offers flexibility in planning workflow jobs such as [cron workflows](https://github.com/aelassas/Wexflow/wiki/Cron-scheduling).

Furthermore, Wexflow makes use of [LiteDB](http://www.litedb.org/) NoSQL Document Store database in its server and backend which enhance and improve the performance of this workflow engine.

Just to give you an idea of what Wexflow does, this is a screenshot from the "Designer" page. Using the "Designer" page, we get a nice visual overview of the dependency graph of the workflow. Each node represents a task which has to be run:
